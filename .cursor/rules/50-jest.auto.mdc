description: Jest testing conventions.
globs:
  - "**/jest.config.js"
  - "**/*.{spec,test}.{ts,tsx}"
  - "**/__tests__/**"
---

- Use the `ts-jest` preset; see `packages/runtime/jest.config.js` for example.
- Place tests under `__tests__/` or with `.test.ts` suffix.
- Use the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in tests.
- Store coverage output in `coverage/`.
- Snapshots, if used, should live next to the test file in `__snapshots__`.
