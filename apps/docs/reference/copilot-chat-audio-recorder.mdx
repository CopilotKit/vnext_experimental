description: Stub audio recorder used by CopilotChatInput
---

`CopilotChatAudioRecorder` renders the animated waveform and exposes a simple recorder interface for transcription mode.
The default implementation is a stub—perfect for UI demos and easy to swap out for a real recorder.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { CopilotChatAudioRecorder } from "@copilotkitnext/react";

<CopilotChatAudioRecorder className="h-10 rounded bg-slate-900/80" />;
```

## Imperative API

The component forwards a ref with the following interface:

```ts
interface AudioRecorderHandle {
  state: "idle" | "recording" | "processing";
  start(): Promise<void>;
  stop(): Promise<Blob>;
  dispose(): void;
}
```

`CopilotChatInput` uses this handle to start/stop recording automatically when switching modes. The bundled recorder
returns an empty `Blob`—swap it with your own implementation for real audio capture.

## Styling

- Uses a `<canvas>` element to draw a fake waveform animation.
- Accepts `className`/`style` props to customize size and appearance.
