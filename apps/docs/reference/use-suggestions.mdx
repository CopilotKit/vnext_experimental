description: React hook for accessing AI chat suggestions
---

`useSuggestions` exposes the live set of CopilotKit chat suggestions for an agent. It keeps UI state in sync with the
CopilotKit runtime, provides helpers to reload or clear suggestions, and tracks the loading state for you.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { useSuggestions } from "@copilotkitnext/react";

function SuggestionList() {
  const { suggestions, isLoading, reloadSuggestions, clearSuggestions } = useSuggestions();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <p>Loading suggestions…</p>;
  }

  if (!suggestions.length) {
    return (
      <div className="empty">
        <p>No suggestions yet.</p>
        <button onClick={reloadSuggestions}>Refresh</button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {suggestions.map((suggestion) => (
          <li key={suggestion.id}>{suggestion.title ?? suggestion.message}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={clearSuggestions}>Clear all</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Parameters

### agentId

`string` **optional**

By default the hook resolves the agent ID from the nearest `CopilotChatConfigurationProvider` (falling back to
`"default"`). Pass `agentId` when you want to read suggestions for a specific agent regardless of the active chat
configuration.

```tsx
const { suggestions } = useSuggestions({ agentId: "support" });
```

## Return Value

The hook returns an object with four fields:

| Field              | Type               | Description                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `suggestions`      | `Suggestion[]`     | The current list of suggestions for the agent.                 |
| `isLoading`        | `boolean`          | `true` while suggestions are being generated or refreshed.     |
| `reloadSuggestions`| `() => void`       | Requests a fresh set of suggestions from the runtime.          |
| `clearSuggestions` | `() => void`       | Clears the suggestions cached for the agent.                   |

## Behavior

- Subscribes to CopilotKit suggestion events (`onSuggestionsChanged`, `onSuggestionsStartedLoading`,
  `onSuggestionsFinishedLoading`, `onSuggestionsConfigChanged`).
- Re-computes the agent ID when the surrounding chat configuration changes.
- Keeps local state in sync with the runtime cache so components re-render whenever suggestions update.

## Refreshing Suggestions

`reloadSuggestions` triggers CopilotKit to regenerate suggestions. The runtime emits loading events which the hook uses
to toggle `isLoading`.

```tsx
const { isLoading, reloadSuggestions } = useSuggestions();

return (
  <button onClick={reloadSuggestions} disabled={isLoading}>
    {isLoading ? "Refreshing…" : "Refresh suggestions"}
  </button>
);
```

## Clearing Suggestions

`clearSuggestions` removes any cached suggestions for the agent. This is useful for flows where suggestions should be
reset after a user takes an action.

```tsx
const { clearSuggestions } = useSuggestions({ agentId: "assistant" });

return <button onClick={clearSuggestions}>Reset suggestions</button>;
```

## Tips

- When used alongside `useConfigureSuggestions`, the hook automatically reflects any dynamic or static suggestion
  configuration you register.
- Because the hook subscribes to updates, place it in components that need live data. For static reads (for example,
  logging) call `copilotkit.getSuggestions(agentId)` directly.
