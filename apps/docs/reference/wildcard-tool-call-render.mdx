description: Default renderer for tool calls without a custom component
---

`WildcardToolCallRender` is a ready-to-use component that displays any tool call in CopilotChat. It is registered as a
catch‑all (`name: "*"`) renderer and shows the tool name, execution status, arguments, and optional result in an
expandable card.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { WildcardToolCallRender } from "@copilotkitnext/react";

copilotkit.addToolCallRenderer(WildcardToolCallRender);
```

Once registered, any tool call without a more specific renderer appears in the chat with expandable “Arguments” and
“Result” sections—perfect for debugging or exposing raw tool output.

## Features

- Works for **any** tool (`name: "*"`).
- Indicates status (`inProgress`, `executing`, `complete`) with color-coded badges.
- Displays tool arguments and serialized results inside scrollable code blocks.
- Allows users to collapse/expand the details.

## Customization

Use it as-is for a quick inspector, or copy the component from the source to create your own variant (e.g., styling,
filters). Because it’s built with `defineToolCallRenderer`, it benefits from strong typing over the renderer props.
