title: useConfigureSuggestions
description: Register static or dynamic chat suggestions for an agent
---

`useConfigureSuggestions` wires CopilotKit suggestion definitions into the runtime. You can provide static button
suggestions, fetch dynamic suggestions from your own API, or disable suggestions entirely—all scoped to a specific
agent if needed.

## Basic Usage (Static Suggestions)

```tsx
import { useConfigureSuggestions } from "@copilotkitnext/react";

function StaticSuggestions() {
  useConfigureSuggestions({
    type: "static",
    suggestions: [
      { id: "summarize", message: "Summarize the conversation" },
      { id: "next-steps", message: "Propose next steps" },
    ],
  });

  return null;
}
```

## Dynamic Suggestions

Dynamic configs let CopilotKit call back into your code whenever suggestions are needed.

```tsx
useConfigureSuggestions({
  type: "dynamic",
  instructions: "Suggest follow-up actions for the conversation",
  providerAgentId: "assistant", // optional, defaults to the chat agent
});
```

The runtime will ask your agent to generate suggestions using the provided instructions. Use
`copilotkit.reloadSuggestions()` (e.g., via `useSuggestions`) whenever the context changes.

## Parameters

### config

`DynamicSuggestionsConfig | StaticSuggestionsConfig | null`

- `type: "static"` – Provide an array of suggestion objects `{ id, message, title?, isLoading? }`.
- `type: "dynamic"` – Provide `instructions`, optional `consumerAgentId`, and optional `providerAgentId`. The agent
  referenced by `providerAgentId` generates suggestions.
- `available: "disabled"` – Pass `null` or set `available` to disable suggestions.

### options.deps

`ReadonlyArray<unknown>` **optional**

An array of dependencies that should trigger a reload when they change. Equivalent to a dependency list passed to
`useEffect`.

```tsx
useConfigureSuggestions(config, { deps: [customerId, ticketId] });
```

## Behavior

- Registers the suggestions config with CopilotKit and automatically tears it down when the hook unmounts.
- Automatically reloads suggestions when the configuration changes (deep comparison) or when dependencies change.
- If `consumerAgentId` is omitted or `"*"`, the configuration applies to whatever agent is active in the surrounding
  `CopilotChatConfigurationProvider`.
- When the configuration targets a single agent, only that agent’s suggestions are reloaded.

## Disabling Suggestions

```tsx
useConfigureSuggestions({ available: "disabled", type: "static", suggestions: [] });
```

This clears existing suggestions and prevents the runtime from generating new ones.

## Tips

- Pair `useConfigureSuggestions` with `useSuggestions` inside the same component tree to both register and consume
  suggestions.
- Use the `deps` option when your config depends on user input (e.g., ticket ID). CopilotKit will reload suggestions
  whenever those values change.
- Dynamic configs run on the agent; static configs are great for deterministic helper buttons such as “Summarize,”
  “Create follow-up email,” etc.
