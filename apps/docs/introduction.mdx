## What is CopilotKit?

CopilotKit is a powerful, framework-agnostic toolkit for building AI-powered applications. It provides a seamless way to integrate intelligent AI agents into your React and Angular applications, enabling you to create context-aware, interactive AI experiences.

CopilotKit connects your application's logic, state, and user context to AI agents, giving you the tools to build, deploy, and monitor AI-assisted features that feel intuitive, helpful, and deeply integrated into your user experience.

## Architecture

CopilotKit is thoughtfully architected to scale with you, your teams, and your product. The framework consists of several key components:

- **Core**: Framework-agnostic core functionality for managing agents, tools, and state
- **React Package**: React-specific components, hooks, and providers
- **Angular Package**: Angular-specific components, services, and directives
- **Runtime**: Server-side runtime for handling agent execution and tool calls
