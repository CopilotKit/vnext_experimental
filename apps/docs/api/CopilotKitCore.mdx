# CopilotKitCore

`CopilotKitCore` is the client-side cross-framework orchestration layer that coordinates communication between your application's UI, local agents, and the remote Copilot runtime.

At its heart, CopilotKitCore maintains the authoritative state for three critical elements:
- **Agents**: Both local and remote AI agents that power your application's intelligence
- **Frontend Tools**: Functions that agents can call to interact with your UI
- **Runtime Metadata**: Connection status, versioning, and configuration details

## Creating a CopilotKitCore Instance

When you instantiate CopilotKitCore, you're setting up the foundation for all AI interactions in your application. Here are the configuration options you can provide:

- `runtimeUrl?`: `string`
  The endpoint where your CopilotRuntime server is hosted. When provided, CopilotKitCore will automatically connect and discover available remote agents.

- `headers?`: `Record<string, string>`
  Custom HTTP headers to include with every request. Useful for authentication tokens or tracking headers.

- `properties?`: `Record<string, unknown>`
  Application-specific data that gets forwarded to agents as context. This might include user preferences, application state, or feature flags.

- `agents?`: `Record<string, AbstractAgent>`
  Local agents that run directly in the browser. The key becomes the agent's identifier.

- `tools?`: `FrontendTool<any>[]`
  Frontend functions that agents can invoke, such as updating UI elements or fetching client-side data.

## Core Properties

Once initialized, CopilotKitCore exposes several properties that provide insight into its current state:

### Runtime Configuration

- `runtimeUrl`: `string | undefined`
  The current runtime endpoint. Changing this property triggers a connection attempt to the new runtime. Setting it to `undefined` gracefully disconnects from the current runtime.

- `runtimeVersion`: `string | undefined`
  The version of the connected runtime, helpful for compatibility checks and debugging.

- `runtimeConnectionStatus`: `CopilotKitCoreRuntimeConnectionStatus`
  Tracks the current connection state, allowing you to respond to connection changes in your UI.

### State Management

- `headers`: `Record<string, string>`
  The current request headers. You can modify these directly to update authentication or add new headers on the fly.

- `properties`: `Record<string, unknown>`
  The application properties being forwarded to agents. Update these when your application state changes.

- `agents`: `Readonly<Record<string, AbstractAgent>>`
  A combined view of all available agents, merging local agents with those discovered from the runtime. This is read-only to prevent accidental modifications.

- `tools`: `Readonly<FrontendTool<any>[]>`
  The complete list of registered frontend tools available to agents.

- `context`: `Readonly<Record<string, Context>>`
  Contextual information that agents can use to make more informed decisions.

## Working with Configuration

These methods allow you to dynamically update CopilotKitCore's configuration after initialization:

### `setRuntimeUrl(runtimeUrl: string | undefined): void`

Changes the runtime endpoint and manages the connection lifecycle. This is useful when switching between different environments or disconnecting from the runtime entirely.

### `setHeaders(headers: Record<string, string>): void`

Replaces all HTTP headers. Subscribers are notified so they can react to authentication changes or other header updates.

### `setProperties(properties: Record<string, unknown>): void`

Updates the properties forwarded to agents. Use this when your application state changes in ways that might affect agent behavior.

## Managing Agents

Agents are the AI-powered components that process requests and generate responses. CopilotKitCore provides several methods to manage them:

### `setAgents(agents: Record<string, AbstractAgent>): void`

Replaces all local agents while preserving remote agents from the runtime. This is useful for completely reconfiguring your local agent setup.

### `addAgent(params: CopilotKitCoreAddAgentParams): void`

Adds a single agent to your application. The agent is immediately available for use.
- `params.id`: A unique identifier for the agent
- `params.agent`: The agent instance to add

### `removeAgent(id: string): void`

Removes a local agent by its identifier. Remote agents from the runtime cannot be removed this way.

### `getAgent(id: string): AbstractAgent | undefined`

Retrieves an agent by its identifier. Returns `undefined` if the agent doesn't exist or if the runtime is still connecting.

### `connectAgent(params: CopilotKitCoreConnectAgentParams): Promise<RunAgentResult>`

Establishes a connection with an agent, allowing it to maintain state across interactions. This is useful for agents that need to track conversation history.
- `params.agent`: The agent to connect
- `params.agentId?`: Override the agent's default identifier

### `runAgent(params: CopilotKitCoreRunAgentParams): Promise<RunAgentResult>`

Executes an agent with optional initial messages. The agent processes the request and returns its response.
- `params.agent`: The agent to execute
- `params.withMessages?`: Initial messages to send to the agent
- `params.agentId?`: Override the agent's default identifier

## Managing Context

Context provides agents with additional information about the current state of your application:

### `addContext(context: Context): string`

Adds contextual information that agents can reference. Returns a unique identifier for later removal.
- `context.description`: A human-readable description of what this context represents
- `context.value`: The actual context data

### `removeContext(id: string): void`

Removes previously added context using its identifier.

## Managing Tools

Tools are functions that agents can call to interact with your application:

### `addTool<T>(tool: FrontendTool<T>): void`

Registers a new frontend tool. If a tool with the same name and agent scope already exists, the registration is skipped to prevent duplicates.

### `removeTool(id: string, agentId?: string): void`

Removes a tool from the registry. You can remove tools globally or for specific agents:
- When `agentId` is provided, removes the tool only for that agent
- When `agentId` is omitted, removes only global tools with the matching name

### `getTool(params: CopilotKitCoreGetToolParams): FrontendTool<any> | undefined`

Retrieves a tool by name, with intelligent fallback behavior:
- `params.toolName`: The tool's name
- `params.agentId?`: Look for agent-specific tools first
- If an agent-specific tool isn't found, it falls back to global tools

### `setTools(tools: FrontendTool<any>[]): void`

Replaces all tools at once. Useful for completely reconfiguring available tools.

## Event Subscription System

CopilotKitCore implements a robust event system that allows you to react to state changes and agent activities:

### `subscribe(subscriber: CopilotKitCoreSubscriber): () => void`

Registers a subscriber to receive events. The returned function can be called to unsubscribe, making cleanup straightforward.

### `unsubscribe(subscriber: CopilotKitCoreSubscriber): void`

Manually removes a subscriber if you prefer explicit cleanup over using the returned function.

## Understanding Runtime Connections

When you provide a `runtimeUrl`, CopilotKitCore initiates a connection to your CopilotRuntime server. Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. CopilotKitCore sends a GET request to `{runtimeUrl}/info`
2. The runtime responds with available agents and metadata
3. For each remote agent, CopilotKitCore creates a ProxiedCopilotRuntimeAgent instance
4. These remote agents are merged with your local agents
5. Subscribers are notified of the connection status and agent availability

## Runtime Connection States

The connection to your runtime can be in one of four states:

- `Disconnected`: No runtime URL is configured, or the connection was intentionally closed
- `Connecting`: Actively attempting to establish a connection with the runtime
- `Connected`: Successfully connected and remote agents are available
- `Error`: The connection attempt failed, but CopilotKitCore will continue with local agents only

## Subscribing to Events

The event subscription system allows you to build reactive UIs that respond to CopilotKitCore's state changes. Each event provides both the CopilotKitCore instance and relevant data:

### `onRuntimeConnectionStatusChanged`

Notified whenever the connection to the runtime changes state. Use this to show connection indicators in your UI.

```typescript
onRuntimeConnectionStatusChanged?: (event: {
  copilotkit: CopilotKitCore;
  status: CopilotKitCoreRuntimeConnectionStatus;
}) => void | Promise<void>;
```

### `onToolExecutionStart`

Fired when an agent begins executing a tool. Useful for showing loading states or activity indicators.

```typescript
onToolExecutionStart?: (event: {
  copilotkit: CopilotKitCore;
  toolCallId: string;
  agentId: string;
  toolName: string;
  args: unknown;
}) => void | Promise<void>;
```

### `onToolExecutionEnd`

Fired when tool execution completes, whether successfully or with an error. Use this to update your UI based on the results.

```typescript
onToolExecutionEnd?: (event: {
  copilotkit: CopilotKitCore;
  toolCallId: string;
  agentId: string;
  toolName: string;
  result: string;
  error?: string;
}) => void | Promise<void>;
```

### `onAgentsChanged`

Notified when agents are added, removed, or updated. This includes both local changes and runtime discovery.

```typescript
onAgentsChanged?: (event: {
  copilotkit: CopilotKitCore;
  agents: Readonly<Record<string, AbstractAgent>>;
}) => void | Promise<void>;
```

### `onContextChanged`

Fired when context items are added or removed. Use this to keep UI elements in sync with available context.

```typescript
onContextChanged?: (event: {
  copilotkit: CopilotKitCore;
  context: Readonly<Record<string, Context>>;
}) => void | Promise<void>;
```

### `onPropertiesChanged`

Notified when application properties are updated. Useful for debugging or showing current configuration.

```typescript
onPropertiesChanged?: (event: {
  copilotkit: CopilotKitCore;
  properties: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>;
}) => void | Promise<void>;
```

### `onHeadersChanged`

Fired when HTTP headers are modified. Important for tracking authentication state changes.

```typescript
onHeadersChanged?: (event: {
  copilotkit: CopilotKitCore;
  headers: Readonly<Record<string, string>>;
}) => void | Promise<void>;
```

### `onError`

The central error handler for all CopilotKitCore operations. Every error includes a code and contextual information to help with debugging.

```typescript
onError?: (event: {
  copilotkit: CopilotKitCore;
  error: Error;
  code: CopilotKitCoreErrorCode;
  context: Record<string, any>;
}) => void | Promise<void>;
```

## Error Handling

CopilotKitCore provides detailed error information through typed error codes, making it easier to handle different failure scenarios appropriately:

### Understanding Error Codes

Each error is categorized with a specific code that indicates what went wrong:

- `RUNTIME_INFO_FETCH_FAILED`: The attempt to fetch runtime information failed. This might indicate network issues or an incorrect runtime URL.

- `AGENT_CONNECT_FAILED`: Failed to establish a connection with an agent. Check that the agent is properly configured.

- `AGENT_RUN_FAILED`: The agent execution failed. This could be due to invalid messages or agent-side errors.

- `AGENT_RUN_FAILED_EVENT`: The agent reported a failure through its event stream.

- `AGENT_RUN_ERROR_EVENT`: The agent emitted an error event during execution.

- `TOOL_ARGUMENT_PARSE_FAILED`: The arguments provided to a tool couldn't be parsed. This usually indicates a mismatch between expected and actual parameters.

- `TOOL_HANDLER_FAILED`: A tool's handler function threw an error during execution.

## TypeScript Types and Interfaces

CopilotKitCore is fully typed to provide excellent IDE support and catch errors at compile time:

### `CopilotKitCoreConfig`

The configuration object used when creating a new CopilotKitCore instance:

```typescript
interface CopilotKitCoreConfig {
  runtimeUrl?: string;
  agents?: Record<string, AbstractAgent>;
  headers?: Record<string, string>;
  properties?: Record<string, unknown>;
  tools?: FrontendTool<any>[];
}
```

### `CopilotKitCoreAddAgentParams`

Parameters for adding an agent after initialization:

```typescript
interface CopilotKitCoreAddAgentParams {
  id: string;
  agent: AbstractAgent;
}
```

### `CopilotKitCoreRunAgentParams`

Configuration for running an agent:

```typescript
interface CopilotKitCoreRunAgentParams {
  agent: AbstractAgent;
  withMessages?: Message[];
  agentId?: string;
}
```

### `CopilotKitCoreConnectAgentParams`

Parameters for connecting to an agent:

```typescript
interface CopilotKitCoreConnectAgentParams {
  agent: AbstractAgent;
  agentId?: string;
}
```

### `CopilotKitCoreGetToolParams`

Configuration for retrieving tools:

```typescript
interface CopilotKitCoreGetToolParams {
  toolName: string;
  agentId?: string;
}
```

### `CopilotKitCoreSubscriber`

The complete interface for event subscribers. Implement any combination of these handlers based on your needs. See the Event Subscription section above for detailed information about each event.
